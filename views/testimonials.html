                “I initially sought treatment for my lower back which is susceptible to bad spasms stemming from a lifting injury a few years ago. Liên has been able to give me immediate relief from my back spasms and has pointed out ways to help heal and strengthen it. I also sought treatment for my knee, which had a small tear in the medial meniscus from a running injury. Within a couple of visits, I was back running again and the inflammation pains disappeared. Liên is a gifted healer and always there to answer my health related questions.”

                "I went to see Liên with several health issues. I had struggled for years with allergies, fatigue, muscle aches, back, neck and shoulder pain and had recently been diagnosed with sleep apnea. The sleep apnea prompted me to try acupuncture as an alternative to the cumbersome CPAP machine. I was amazed at the results I experienced even after the first two visits. Although my focus was on sleep apnea, most of my other symptoms began to improve quickly. The back, neck and shoulder pain that I had suffered with for years was subsiding, my allergies were less active, and after a few weeks I began to sleep better. I am extremely happy with the results I experienced. Liên is a true professional with a gentle, caring approach and the expertise needed to produce results."

                “I have been a patient of Liên’s for the past year. I am a basketball referee, and sprinting up to three miles a night for most of the winter takes its toll on my knees, lower back, and ankles. Last season I suffered from severe pain in my ankles. My first treatment with Liên showed me just how much passion she has for healing. Her holistic approach is founded in science, technology, customs, and ancient eastern methods that Western medicine may not understand. Her treatment sessions are one hour long and consist of one-on-one spiritual, physical, and mental healing. This balance has produced great results for me. She helped heal my pain, while offering a holistic approach to healing and good health in general. Her attention to detail, positive energy, and knowledge of the body make her a special healer. I would strongly recommend Liên to anyone in need of healing.”

                “As a marathon runner, I regularly make significant demands on my body. Through my own fault, not stretching enough, I can tighten my lower back or misalign it. Furthermore, with my professional travel schedule I often eat poorly and sleep irregularly. Each and every time I see Liên for treatment I find myself completely rejuvenated. I like to think of acupuncture as a massage for the nervous system, but one with purpose. I feel more relaxed and more alert, as if I had the perfect night’s sleep and awoke at the perfect moment in a sleep cycle. Liên's thorough approach includes an interview to understand how best to direct treatment, depending on my circumstances at the time. She compliments the acupuncture with tuina, moxibustion, and massage as needed. I can wholeheartedly recommend Liên as an excellent practitioner, whether it is for a specific problem or just preventative care.”

                “As a busy professional, stress has begun to take a toll on my body, particularly with respect to nerve and muscle pain in my lower neck and shoulders. I have never been fond of needles and was extremely nervous, and skeptical, about the potential benefits of acupuncture. However, my discomfort became so great, and as surgery was not an option I wanted to pursue, I decided to try acupuncture with Liên. Liên has an amazingly gentle style that put me immediately at ease. She began by taking a thorough medical history and a detailed description of my areas of pain, and she obtains updates from me at the beginning of each session and keeps written records of the information I provide to her. Liên was extremely sensitive to my initial nervousness about acupuncture and began my treatment with just a few needles, increasing the amount as our sessions progressed so that I would develop a gradual comfort level. It wasn’t long before I began to feel substantial relief from my pain and now I look forward to my sessions with Liên. Acupuncture with Liên has greatly diminished my pain and I now am able to reduce our sessions to once or twice a month. My sessions with Liên not only result in diminished pain, but are extremely relaxing and reduce my stress level. I would highly recommend Liên and acupuncture for chronic pain.”

                “I'd suffered from tendonitis for about a year. Periodically it would become inflamed and stay that way for one to two weeks. The pain was constant and intense. Nothing provided relief, not pain killers, not ice, nothing. Then I tried acupuncture with Liên. We did two sessions in one week and the pain was significantly reduced. By the third session, the pain was gone. After that, the same activities that used to inflame the tendonitis didn't aggravate it anymore. I'd strongly recommend acupuncture for anyone with chronic or acute pain. It saved me.”

                “I was diagnosed with degenerative disk disease in my lower back two years ago. After many painful injections it did not help. Reluctantly I tried acupuncture with Liên. I have not felt this good in a long time. She is great with appointment times and VERY professional. I will never stop going to get my treatments. I have been free of heavy duty pain medication since I started my treatments with Liên.”

                “I had suffered from menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, anxiety, mood swings and fatigue. Acupuncture has reduced my hot flashes and night sweats. I have been sleeping better and waking up with more energy. Acupuncture has also balanced out my mood swings and increased my focus and concentration. In addition, Liên worked with me to suggest what foods I should be eating to enhance the work she did. Acupuncture is a wonderful way to treat the symptoms of menopause naturally. Liên is a very kind, knowledgeable, calming and caring professional, and I am so grateful and happy to recommend her to anyone.”

                “The acupuncture treatments for arthritis in my knees have helped to relieve the swelling and the pain. Liên has also treated me for chronic lower back pain and shoulder pain. I always feel relief after each treatment and I look forward to each appointment. My energy has increased and my pain has decreased. I have already recommended acupuncture to several of my friends and will continue to do so. Liên treats me with respect and looks at the ‘whole’ me, not just the parts that are hurting that particular day. Acupuncture is a positive experience for me.”
